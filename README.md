# CM2030_asteroidClone
A 2D game remake to explore simulating gravity, friction, particles and collision detection

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Midterm submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_angryBirds
  CM2030_noisyGrid
  CM2030_solarSystem

This project utilizes JavaScript, the p5.js library, and matter physics library to create an interactable 2D world.
